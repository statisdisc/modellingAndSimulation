# Using Machine Learning for Advection in Python 2.7
Using a multi-layered neural network and 100,000 sets of training data, a model for the advection (movement) of air can be created.

## Prerequisites
Python 2.7 with NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib installed.

## Example
Analytic solution in black.
Traditional advection scheme in blue (upwind advection).
Neural network solution in red.
